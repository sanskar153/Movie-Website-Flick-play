                others exhibit a deadlier reaction. But when the pill escalates crime within the city to dangerous levels, a local cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) teams with a teenage dealer (Dominique Fishback) and a former soldier fueled by a secret vendetta
                (Jamie Foxx) to fight power with power and risk taking the pill in order to track down and stop the group responsible for creating it.....
